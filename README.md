# MyReads React Project
Built for the Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree course by Bryce Rairden. This React Project allows the user to select from a database of books and visually add them the catagories: Currently Reading, Want to Read, and Read. It then displays the cover, title, and authors of those books for the user. I utilized the walkthrough by Doug Brown during the development of this project https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcL7-7cRpkQ
